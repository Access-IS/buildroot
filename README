Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build the kernel and rootfilesystem for swallow boards, do the following:

make sure you have build the sdk first, git@10.1.30.30:Lalith/sdk.git
and that it resides in $(HOME)/sdk


1) run 'make distclean ; make swallow_defconfig'
2) run 'make'
3) wait till it compiles
4) find the kernel (zImage), root filesystem (root.xxxxxx) MD5SUM  in output/images
5) copy both root.xxxxxx AND MD5SUM files to /dev/mtdblock4

The swallow board spi partion 5 (/dev/mtdblock4) should be ext4 formatted. 

symlink root.xxxxxxx to rootfs.squashfs (this is required by the initram stript in kernel to mount the correct version)

when upgrading replace both root.xxxxxx file AND MD5SUM file, and move the symlink to the new root.xxxxxxx


You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!
